# CryptoClipper 
is a Python-based tool designed to monitor the system clipboard for cryptocurrency addresses (BTC and ETH) and replace them with predefined wallet addresses. When compiled into an executable (EXE), it runs in the background, silently swapping recognized addresses to redirect cryptocurrency transfers to the configured wallet. This project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate clipboard manipulation techniques.
